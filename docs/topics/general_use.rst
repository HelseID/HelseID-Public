General Use
===========

As HelseID is based on IdentityServer4 - which is `fully compliant with OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 <https://identityserver4.readthedocs.io/en/release/intro/specs.html>`_ - all general samples showing use of these protocols should work with HelseID.

If you are running Microsoft.NET and/or javascript, you can find samplecode for both clients and APIs below.
